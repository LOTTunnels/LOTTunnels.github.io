# Living Off The Tunnels - LOTTunnels

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/logo.png"></p>

Living Off The Tunnels a.k.a LOTTS Project is community driven project to document digital tunnels which can be abused by threat actors as well by insiders for data exfiltrations, persistence, shell access etc.

The basic idea behind this project is to focus on digital tunnels which have not been abused yet but have high probability of being used by threat actors to compromise organizations and exfiltrate data. 

However, most organizations are dealing with insider threats. Where the organizational employees are in position, having access, opportunity to commit frauds and exfiltrate the data and they do. These techniques i.e. Living Off The Tunnels provides a best opportunity for insiders to perform these illegal and unethical tasks. Thus, organizations having more visibility into this side will be able to put more detection to prevent insider threats for data exfiltration as well as external threats which might be using these tools for malicious purposes. 

It's a great opportunity for everyone to focus more on this side.
