LOTTs project is a list of softwares, binaries, executables which can be used by insiders as well as threat actors for data exfiltration, delivering payloads, forwarding ports and hosting phishing websites.

The inspiration of this project and site template is taken directly from (https://lolbas-project.github.io/) project. Kudos to the team for bringing in amazing projects.

I have started this prject as a personal project, lets see how far this goes!
