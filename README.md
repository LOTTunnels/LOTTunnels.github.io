Living Off The Tunnels a.k.a LOTTS Project is community driven project to document digital tunnels which can be abused by threat actors as well as can be used by insiders for data exfiltrations.

The inspiration of this project and site template is taken directly from (https://lolbas-project.github.io/) project. 

Kudos to the team for bringing in amazing projects.

I have started this project as a personal project, lets see how far this goes!
