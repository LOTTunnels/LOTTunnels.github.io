# Contributing

The best way to contribute is to take a look onto one of the file formats of the files under the _lottunnels\binaries directory however there is also a sample [template](https://github.com/LOTTunnels/LOTTunnels.github.io/blob/main/YML-TEMPLATE.yml). Fork the repository, make the update and ensure that the Jekyll site builds, then submit a pull request.
